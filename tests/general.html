          <p>
            Each of the trigger elements are progressively enhanced (as needed) into buttons. They all open the same modal dialog.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each "button" is assigned their own unique ID, when activated the ID of the specific button used will be stored in a <code>var</code>. The ID will be referred to again when the dialog is closed and focus needs to return to the specific element that opened it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dialog utilizes the value of <code>data-modal-class</code> to add the value as a class to itself, when JavaScript is available.
          </p>
          <p>
            A close <code>button</code> is auto-generated from the script, as there are no manually set close buttons within the dialog.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example the dialog container is focused by default.  This will result in JAWS + Firefox and VoiceOver (on desktop) announcing the accessible name and role of the dialog when its opened.
          </p>
          <p>
            With JAWS and Internet Explorer 11, the accessible name and role of the dialog will be announced, and then the first child element of the dialog, and its role, will be announced.
          </p>
          <p>
            With NVDA and Firefox, NVDA will announce the accessible name of the dialog, but will <b>not announce the dialog role</b>. It will then treat the dialog as if it was a new document loaded, and begin reading the contents of the dialog in sequential order.

            In this test the heading is set to receive autofocus.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Please note:</strong> that with default NVDA settings, NVDA will be verbose in the initial announcement of the dialog if the heading is focused by default. Ideally, the dialog container or a form control within a dialog should be the initially focused element. Per the latter, an <code>aria-describedby</code> should be used to provide a succinct description of the dialog's contents.
          </p>
          <p>
            JAWS and VoiceOver will announce the name of the dialog, the dialog role, and then announce the heading text and element. For instance:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>VoiceOver (desktop high sierra):</b>
            <q>Heading Text (from aria-labelledby), <i>dialog</i>, <i>heading level 2</i>, Heading Text"</q>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>JAWS (2018):</b>
            <q>Heading Text (from aria-labelledby), <i>dialog</i>, Heading Text, <i>heading level 2</i></q>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>NVDA (2018.1):</b>
            <q>Heading Text (from aria-labelledby), <i>dialog</i>, Heading Text, <i>heading level 2</i>. Heading Text. <i>Heading level 2</i> Heading Text. <b>all other contents of dialog are announced</b>.</q>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>VoiceOver (iOS):</b>

            Here the dialog has an auto-generated close button, which is focused when the dialog is opened. The text of the close button and a class are passed to the generated close button via the <code>data-modal-close</code> and <code>data-modal-close-class</code> attributes respectively. When an auto-generated close button has a text string set, it will not receive the styles of an "X" close button.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <code>data-modal-description</code> has been added to the child element (in this case a <code>p</code> element), which serves as the primary description of the dialog. This attribute will trigger a function to setup an appropriate <code>ID</code> and <code>aria-describedby</code> for the dialog.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the dialog is opened and the close button is focused, the accessible name of the dialog, its description, and the close button are all announced by screen readers, except for TalkBack + Chrome.
          </p>
          <p>
            TalkBack (Android Accessibility Suite 6.2) + Android Chrome only announce "OK, button. Double tap to activate".

            An alert dialog should be used when a response is required from a user. Where standard dialogs may allow for multiple passive ways to exit them, such as mouse clicking outside the dialog, or using a close button that provides no concrete commitment from a user that they actually engaged with the dialog's contents; an alert dialog should only be closed via purposeful button activations by a user.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, an alert dialog may have a single "OK" button to indicate that the user is compliant with the message the dialog presents to them. Or a specific choice of "confirm" or "deny" buttons, to indicate that a user agrees or disagrees with the dialog's primary message.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this in mind, it should be noted that an alert dialog will not auto generate close buttons. Authors should enter the specific actionable elements to dismiss the dialog. Alert dialogs do not allow for a mouse click or tap outside of the dialog to dismiss.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an alert dialog contains a short message and a single actionable item, then that item may be autofocused, and the dialog may utilize <code>aria-describedby</code> to read out the contents of the dialog to the user, to decrease a user having to navigate the dialog themselves.  If an alert dialog contains more than a confirmation button to dismiss it, e.g. there is a confirm, deny, or other choices to dismiss the dialog, then autofocusing a choice may lead some users to believe that is their only choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this instance, the dialog itself should be given focus so a user can parse through the dialog and understand their options via their own discovery methods.
